### Description
Most people working in an office environment need to account for their time to managers or project managers. This task is notoriously painful because we invariably collect the information just before it is due, and have to replay the past in our minds to extract what we were doing. Most of us consider this a waste of time because we see little value in our efforts. Enter TaskClerk – TaskClerk allows you to capture timesheet information at the point you change tasks. This reduces your requirement to remember what you were doing and reduces the effort in working out how long you spent doing a task. The application also provides the user with a graphical report so the benefits of capturing your time are immediately evident and the user gets a buzz out of watching his or her graph develop during the day. With an extensible export engine, developers can create exporters to load data into any central organisation time recording system. Time recording information could be an important tool in an organisations costing process, if we collected near true time information about the tasks we worked on
Individuals could manage their time on tasks more effectively by being more aware of the time it takes to do tasks.
Organisations could create a valid picture of where time is spent producing services and products.
TaskClerk is not meant to be a tool to beat employees up with, fundamentally the ethos behind this staff productivity tool is to allow staff to collect and report their time in a responsible way – empowering the employee in this office task.
